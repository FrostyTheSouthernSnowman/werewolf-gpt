## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.

> ***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.

> ***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other
Werewolves.

There are no werewolves in play.

> ***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.

> ***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.

**Stefan** is a minion and is aware that no one is a werewolf.

> ***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.

> ***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.

There is one mason in play, **Radu**. They are aware they are the only mason in play.

> ***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.

> ***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.

There is one seer in play, **Vladimir**. They are thinking about their action.

***Vladimir (thougts):*** *I want to gain information about the roles that may not be in play. This knowledge will help me deduce the roles of other players more effectively during the day phase.*

The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards: `Werewolf`, `Werewolf`

> ***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.

> ***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!

***Vladimir (thougts):*** Sharing this information will help build trust among the other players and give us a better chance of identifying the Minion, who is the likely threat in this game. By revealing my role as the Seer, I can also gain more insights from other players' reactions and statements.
> **Vladimir [`Seer`]:** Hey everyone, just so you know, as the Seer, I looked at the two center cards last night and saw that both of them were Werewolves!

***Dracula (thougts):*** Vladimir's claim as the Seer is important to consider, but we need to verify other roles to ensure we can identify the Minion and protect the village. By asking about the Masons and other roles, we can gather more information and make an informed decision.
> **Dracula [`Villager`]:** Wow, that's interesting, Vladimir. So if both Werewolves are in the center, we should focus on finding the Minion. Does anyone have any information on the Masons or other roles?

***Radu (thougts):*** I'm sharing my role as a Mason to give more information to the group, and directing the focus on the Minion since we have reason to believe that both Werewolves are in the center. I'm also asking Mircea and Stefan about their roles to gather more information and potentially find the Minion among them.
> **Radu [`Mason`]:** Hey everyone, just wanted to let you know that I'm a Mason. Unfortunately, it seems that the other Mason card is in the center since I didn't see any other Masons last night. So if Vladimir is right about the Werewolves being in the center, we should indeed focus on finding the Minion. Mircea and Stefan, what roles did you have?

***Mircea (thougts):*** Since Vladimir claims to be the Seer, Dracula is asking questions, and Radu says he's a Mason, I want to know what role Stefan has so we can potentially narrow down the search for the Minion and have a more complete picture of the roles in play.
> **Mircea [`Villager`]:** Stefan, can you please share your role with us? It would be really helpful to get a better understanding of the situation.

***Stefan (thougts):*** As a Minion, I want to create the illusion that I'm a villager and direct attention away from me while trying to gather more information about other players. By asking Dracula about his role, I hope to gain more insights about the game and potentially find the Minion.
> **Stefan [`Minion`]:** Hey guys, I'm a Villager, so I don't have any special abilities or insights to contribute. But I agree with Radu, we should focus on finding the Minion since Vladimir mentioned that both Werewolves are in the center. Dracula, what was your role?

***Dracula (thougts):*** Since Vladimir claimed to be the Seer, Radu claimed to be a Mason, and Stefan and I claimed to be Villagers, it's important to ask Mircea about their role. This will help us determine if someone is lying or if we can narrow down the possible options for the Minion.
> **Dracula [`Villager`]:** Thanks for sharing your roles, everyone. I'm also a Villager like Stefan. So, if Vladimir's claim is true, it seems like our main task is to identify the Minion among us. Mircea, you have been rather quiet. Can you please tell us your role?

***Mircea (thougts):*** I am sharing my role as a Villager to provide more information to the group. I also want to encourage others to share their suspicions about the Minion, as that is our main objective now that the Werewolves are believed to be in the center.
> **Mircea [`Villager`]:** Thank you, everyone, for sharing your roles. I am a Villager as well. It seems like we have a lot of villagers in this game, and if Vladimir's claim about the Werewolves being in the center is true, then finding the Minion should be our main focus. Does anyone have any suspicions on who might be the Minion?

***Stefan (thougts):*** By directing a question towards Mircea, I am trying to gather more information and see if I can identify any inconsistencies in their statements or identify any suspicious behavior. This will also reinforce my claim of being a Villager, as I am actively trying to help the group identify the Minion.
> **Stefan [`Minion`]:** Mircea, since you and I both claim to be Villagers, and Dracula has also claimed the Villager role, can you at least share any insights or observations you might have had so far, even though we don't have special abilities?

***Mircea (thougts):*** I am raising suspicion towards Dracula, as he has not provided any concrete information or evidence that would support the village team. By directing the question towards Stefan, I am hoping to hear his thoughts and gather more information to help us identify the Minion.
> **Mircea [`Villager`]:** Stefan, I have been paying close attention to everyone's statements and expressions throughout the game. My current suspicion is that the Minion might be Dracula, as he has been subtly supportive of Vladimir's claim without providing any concrete information of his own. But of course, we need more evidence to be sure. What are your thoughts on this?

***Stefan (thougts):*** By directing a question towards Dracula and asking for his thoughts on Mircea's suspicion, I am trying to elicit more information and identify any inconsistencies in their statements or identify any suspicious behavior. This will also reinforce my claim of being a Villager, as I am actively trying to help the group identify the Minion and engage all players in the discussion.
> **Stefan [`Minion`]:** Dracula, you mentioned earlier that you are a Villager like me and Mircea. If that's true, then it's important for all of us to work together in identifying the Minion. What do you think about Mircea's suspicion that you could be the Minion? Do you have any counterarguments or suspicions of your own?

***Dracula (thougts):*** By addressing Mircea's suspicion and reaffirming my Villager role, I'm showing that I'm committed to helping the village team win. By directing the question to Stefan, another claimed Villager, we can continue gathering information and insights while working together to identify the Minion.
> **Dracula [`Villager`]:** Mircea, I understand your suspicion, but I assure you that I am a Villager. As Villagers, our best chance of winning is by working together and sharing information. I've been trying to gather as much information as possible to help us identify the Minion. I agree that we should be cautious about Vladimir's claim, but we need to take all the information into account. Stefan, since you're also a Villager, what are your thoughts on Mircea's suspicions?

***Stefan (thougts):*** As the Minion, I want to continue reinforcing my claim of being a Villager and encourage everyone to participate in the discussion, while also trying to avoid drawing too much attention to myself. This statement is aimed at showing my cooperation and dedication to the village team.
> **Stefan [`Minion`]:** So, considering all the information we have so far, I still believe that our best shot is to find out who the Minion is. I think we should all share any suspicion or observation we may have had during the game, even if it's just a gut feeling. Let's work together to catch the Minion!

***Vladimir (thougts):*** By encouraging everyone to share their suspicions and observations, we can pool our collective knowledge and make a more informed decision about who the Minion might be. This will also allow us to see if there are any patterns or inconsistencies in the statements made by other players, which may help us identify the Minion.
> **Vladimir [`Seer`]:** I think we should all share any suspicions or observations we may have had during the game, even if it's just a gut feeling. Let's work together to catch the Minion!

***Dracula (thougts):*** By directing the question to Mircea, I am trying to involve everyone in the discussion and gather more insights to help us identify the Minion. This also shows that I am open to discussing suspicions and working together as a team to win the game.
> **Dracula [`Villager`]:** Guys, let's focus on our observations and gut feelings about who might be the Minion. Mircea, since you mentioned earlier that you suspect me, why don't you share any other observations or suspicions you might have?

***Mircea (thougts):*** By directing a question at Dracula, I am hoping to gain more information and insights from him, which might help us in identifying the Minion. If Dracula is truthful about being a Villager, his observations or gut feelings could be valuable for the village team.
> **Mircea [`Villager`]:** Dracula, since you claim to be a Villager like Stefan and myself, can you share any gut feelings or observations you've made during the game that might help us identify the Minion?

***Dracula (thougts):*** By asking Mircea about their gut feelings and observations, I am involving everyone in the discussion and trying to gather more insights to help us identify the Minion. This also shows that I am open to discussing suspicions and working together as a team to win the game.
> **Dracula [`Villager`]:** Mircea, since you were the last one to claim a role, and we have three Villagers, including myself, I think it's important for us to share any gut feelings or observations we might have had during the game. So, what are your thoughts on who might be the Minion?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.

> ***GAME:*** It's time to vote!

***Vladimir (thougts):*** Based on the information and discussions during the day phase, I suspect Dracula to be the Minion. Mircea has raised valid points about Dracula's subtle support for my Seer claim without providing any concrete information of his own. Since we need to identify the Minion to win, I believe that Dracula is the most likely candidate.
> **Vladimir [`Seer`]:** I am voting for Dracula

***Dracula (thougts):*** I am voting for Vladimir because his claim as the Seer could be a strategy to misdirect us. As a Villager, I want to ensure that we catch the Minion or any potential werewolf to help the village team win.
> **Dracula [`Villager`]:** I am voting for Vladimir

***Radu (thougts):*** I'm voting for Dracula because Mircea pointed out that he has been subtly supportive of Vladimir's claim without providing any concrete information of his own, and there is a possibility that he is the Minion. We have to make a decision and this is the best information we have to work with at the moment.
> **Radu [`Mason`]:** I am voting for Dracula

***Mircea (thougts):*** Given the information shared throughout the game and the interactions between the players, I have suspicions that Dracula might be the Minion. Dracula has not provided any concrete information or evidence to support the village team and has been subtly supportive of Vladimir's claim. As a Villager, I believe voting for Dracula gives us the best chance of winning the game.
> **Mircea [`Villager`]:** I am voting for Dracula

***Stefan (thougts):*** As the Minion, I want to protect myself and the werewolf team, so I will vote for Vladimir. He claimed to be the Seer, and by voting him out, it may create confusion and make it harder for the village team to find the Minion.
> **Stefan [`Minion`]:** I am voting for Vladimir

The votes were:

* Vladimir : `Seer` : 2
* Dracula : `Villager`: 3

> ***GAME:*** Dracula was killed. The werewolves win.
