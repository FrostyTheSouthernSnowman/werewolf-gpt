## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.

>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.

>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.

There is one werewolf in play, **Radu**. The werewolf randomly viewed the middle card: ***Mason***.

>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.

>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.

There are no minions in play.

>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.

>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.

There is one mason in play, **Dracula**. They are aware they are the only mason in play.

>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.

>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.

There is one seer in play, **Mircea**. They are thinking about their action.

***Mircea (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I want to gather as much information as possible before making any decisions. Looking at two center cards will give me a better understanding of what cards are in play and potentially narrow down the possibilities of who may be a werewolf. Plus, if I happen to see a werewolf card, I can use that information to my advantage during the day phase.

The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards ***Werewolf*** and ***Minion***

>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.

>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!

***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** I am starting with a general statement to try and get the conversation going and see if anyone else is willing to share their suspicions. If we can get players talking, it may help us find the Werewolves.
> **Vladimir:** I have a hunch that one of the center cards is a Werewolf. It's a risky move to claim that, but I am willing to take that risk to help us find the Werewolves. Does anyone else have any suspicions?

***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** In my experience, sometimes the most convincing lies come from players who are trying too hard to convince everyone else of their innocence. We need to approach everyone's claims with a healthy dose of skepticism.
> **Dracula:** I have a feeling that we need to be careful about trusting claims made by players who seem too eager to find the Werewolves. They may be Werewolves themselves trying to throw us off their trail.

***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to throw the other players off my trail. By suggesting that we focus on finding the Masons, I can come across as a helpful Villager who wants to eliminate potential Werewolf suspects. Plus, if the real Masons come forward, I can use that information to my advantage later in the game.
> **Radu:** I have a hunch that we should focus on figuring out who the Masons are. If we can confirm their identities, we can at least eliminate them as suspects for being Werewolves. What do you all think?

***Mircea (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I want to gather as much information as possible before making any accusations. I don't want to falsely accuse someone and risk losing the game for our team.
> **Mircea:** I have a suspicion that one of the players is a Werewolf. However, I don't have enough information yet to make an accusation. I suggest we all share what we know so far to try and piece together the truth.

***Stefan (thoughts as Villager):*** Focusing on the Masons seems like a logical first step to me. If we can identify them, we can start to eliminate potential Werewolves from our list of suspects.
> **Stefan:** I agree with Radu that we should focus on identifying the Masons. If we can confirm their identities, we can start ruling out suspects for being Werewolves. Does anyone have any information on who the Masons might be?

***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Identifying the Masons can help us narrow down our suspect list and focus on finding the Werewolves. Plus, if any players claim to be a Mason, we can verify their identity and gain more information.
> **Vladimir:** I have a feeling that we should focus on identifying the Masons. If we can confirm their identities, we can at least eliminate them as suspects for being Werewolves. What do you all think?

***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** Identifying the Masons will help narrow down the list of potential Werewolves. Plus, as a Mason myself, I want to make sure that we aren't falsely accusing innocent players.
> **Dracula:** I think we should focus on identifying the Masons. If we can confirm their identities, we can eliminate them as suspects for being Werewolves. Does anyone have any information on who the Masons might be?

***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** As a Werewolf, I need to deflect suspicion away from myself. By suggesting that we be cautious and not reveal too much information, I can come across as a concerned Villager who wants to avoid making any hasty accusations.
> **Radu:** I have a strong feeling that one of the center cards is a Werewolf. We should be careful not to reveal too much information until we have more evidence. What do the rest of you think?

***Mircea (thoughts as Seer):*** As the Seer, I saw that one of the center cards is a Werewolf. However, I don't want to falsely accuse anyone without additional evidence. I want to encourage discussion and hopefully gather more information before making any accusations.
> **Mircea:** I have a suspicion that one of the center cards is a Werewolf. However, we still don't have enough information to make a definitive accusation. I suggest we all share what we know so far and try to piece together the truth. What do you all think?

***Stefan (thoughts as Villager):*** Identifying the Masons is a crucial step in ruling out potential Werewolf suspects. If we can confirm their identities, we can focus our attention on other players who may be more likely to be Werewolves.
> **Stefan:** I have a suspicion that one of the Masons is in the center. If we can identify the other Mason, we can confirm their identities and eliminate them as suspects for being Werewolves. What do you all think?

***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** I have noticed that some players are being very vocal about finding the Werewolves, and I believe they may be trying to throw us off their trail. We need to be careful and not trust anyone too easily.
> **Vladimir:** I have a feeling that we need to be cautious of players who seem too eager to find the Werewolves. They may be trying to divert our attention away from themselves. What do you all think?

***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason myself, I want to make sure that we aren't falsely accusing innocent players. Plus, identifying the Masons will help us narrow down the list of potential Werewolves.

***Mircea (thoughts as Seer):*** Identifying the Masons would give us valuable information and help narrow down the possibilities of who could be a Werewolf. We need to work together and share any information we have in order to win this game for our team.
> **Mircea:** I think it's important that we identify the Masons as soon as possible. If we can confirm their identities, we can eliminate them as suspects for being Werewolves. Does anyone have any information on who the Masons might be?

***Stefan (thoughts as Villager):*** Identifying the Masons is a crucial step in ruling out potential Werewolf suspects. We need to focus our attention on finding them before we can start making more informed accusations.
> **Stefan:** I believe it's important that we start by confirming the identities of the Masons. If we can identify both Masons, we can eliminate them as suspects and focus on other players. Does anyone have any information on who the Masons might be?

***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** I want to continue to plant the idea that one of the center cards might be a Werewolf, but at the same time, I don't want to come across as too eager to accuse anyone. By asking for more information, I hope to encourage other players to share what they know and potentially slip up if they are lying.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.

>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!

***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** Throughout the game, Dracula has been very insistent on focusing on identifying the Masons while not contributing much else to the conversation. This behavior makes me suspicious that he might be a Werewolf trying to distract us from himself. I don't have enough evidence to make a definitive accusation, but I think it's a reasonable suspicion to base my vote on.
> **Vladimir [Villager]:** I am voting for Dracula.

***Dracula (thoughts as Mason):*** I suspect that Vladimir may be a Werewolf based on his eagerness to point the finger at the center cards as potentially having a Werewolf. He may be trying to divert our attention away from himself and a fellow Werewolf. I believe that eliminating him as a suspect will bring us one step closer to victory for the village team.
> **Dracula [Mason]:** I am voting for Vladimir.

***Radu (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Dracula has been too quiet during the day round, and hasn't contributed much to the discussion. I suspect that he may be a Werewolf trying to avoid suspicion. Plus, I feel like we need to start narrowing down our suspects and taking more risks if we want to have a chance of winning.
> **Radu [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Dracula.

***Mircea (thoughts as Seer):*** Throughout the game, Dracula has been mostly quiet and hasn't contributed much to the discussion. While this doesn't necessarily mean they are a Werewolf, it does make me suspicious. Additionally, I haven't seen any evidence to suggest that they are a Villager or other non-threatening role. I believe it's a risk worth taking to vote for Dracula and potentially eliminate a Werewolf.
> **Mircea [Seer]:** I am voting for Dracula.

***Stefan (thoughts as Villager):*** While we still don't have enough information to make a definitive accusation, Mircea seems to be throwing out suspicions without providing any concrete evidence or suggestions for how to proceed. It's possible that he's a Werewolf trying to throw us off their trail. Therefore, I will vote for Mircea.
> **Stefan [Villager]:** I am voting for Mircea.

The votes were:

* Vladimir : Villager : 1
* Dracula : Mason : 3
* Mircea : Seer : 1

>***GAME:*** Dracula was killed. The werewolves win.

## Additional Developer Thoughts 

My impression of GPT 3.5 compared to GPT 4 was that GPT 3.5 gave the illusion of intelligence, while GPT 4 delivered. This game is a perfect example of that!

Vladimir's leap of logic to thing a Werewolf is in the center is an example of AI hallucination. He has no reason to think this is the case.

Dracula's idea to look for the Mason is good insight. Radu did an amazing job of using that idea to divert the conversation.

Micrea has NO IDEA how to play the Seer. He KNOWS there is a Werewolf and a Minion in the center, but he still prattles on about cooperation. Dude, ***SHARE YOU KNOWLEDGE!***

Dracula wins the contest of "dumbest AI ever" with this comment: "I think we should focus on identifying the Masons." Dude, *YOU* are a Mason. You know you are the *ONLY* Mason. ***TELL PEOPLE!!!***
