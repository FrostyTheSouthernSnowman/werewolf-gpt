## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.

>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.

>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.

There are no werewolves in play.

>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.

>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.

**Stefan** is a minion and is aware that no one is a werewolf.

>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.

>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.

There are two masons in play, **Dragos** and **Ileana**. They are both now aware of each other.

>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.

>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.

There is one seer in play, **Mircea**. They are thinking about their action.

***Mircea (thoughts as Seer):*** As the seer, I want to gather as much information as possible. Looking at two center cards will give me a better understanding of what roles are still in play and who may be lying about their role. It also minimizes the risk of accidentally revealing my own role to another player.

The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards ***Werewolf*** and ***Villager***

>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.

>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!

***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** As a Villager, my main goal is to make sure our team wins by identifying any Werewolves. This statement is a good way to start the conversation and get everyone thinking about who might be suspicious.
> **Vladimir:** I have a feeling that there might be at least one Werewolf among us. I think it's important that we all share any suspicions we have and work together to figure out who it might be.

***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Based on Vladimir's comment, it seems likely that there is at least one Werewolf in the game. As a Mason, I know that Ileana is on the village team, and I believe that Mircea is also likely to be a Villager based on his behavior so far.
> **Dragos:** I have a strong suspicion that at least one of the Werewolves is among us. We should all share any information we have to try and identify them.

***Mircea (thoughts as Seer):*** I want to create a sense of urgency and encourage everyone to share any information they have. It's important that we work together to identify the Werewolf and vote to kill them off before they have a chance to kill any of us.
> **Mircea:** I had a feeling that at least one of the Werewolves might be among us, and now that the Seer has revealed that there is a Werewolf card in the center, my suspicions are confirmed. We need to work together to figure out who it might be and vote to kill them off before they kill any of us. Does anyone have any information or suspicions they want to share?

***Ileana (thoughts as Mason):*** I want to bring attention to the possibility of deception and encourage other players to share their observations. This could help us identify any potential Werewolves.
> **Ileana:** I have a feeling that the Werewolves might be trying to deceive us by pretending to be Villagers. Has anyone noticed any suspicious behavior or inconsistencies among the players?

> **Stefan:** I have a strong feeling that at least one Werewolf is among us. We should all be sharing any information or suspicions we have and work together to identify them before they kill any of us. Does anyone have any information they'd like to share?

> **Vladimir:** I have been thinking about our previous conversations, and I have a strong suspicion that there might be a Werewolf among us. It's possible that they are trying to blend in and act like a Villager or Seer. I think we should be extra vigilant and pay close attention to any unusual behavior or inconsistencies in players' stories.

***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Based on the conversations we've had so far, it seems like there is a high likelihood that one or both of the Werewolves are trying to blend in and deceive us. By raising this issue, I hope to encourage other players to pay more attention to the details and help us identify any suspicious behavior.
> **Dragos:** I have been thinking about our interactions so far and I have a suspicion that one of the Werewolves might be pretending to be a Villager or Seer. We should be extra vigilant and pay close attention to any unusual behavior or inconsistencies in players' stories. Does anyone else have any suspicions or information they want to share?

***Mircea (thoughts as Seer):*** By bringing up the Masons, I am trying to create a sense of urgency and encourage players to share any information they have. If there is a Werewolf among the Masons, it's important that we identify and vote to kill them off before they have a chance to kill any of us.
> **Mircea:** I have been thinking about our interactions so far and I have a suspicion that one of the Masons might be a Werewolf. I think we should all be extra vigilant and pay close attention to the Masons' behavior and interactions in the game. Does anyone else share my suspicion or have any information about the Masons?

***Ileana (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason myself, I know that we are a powerful force in the village team. However, if one of us has turned to the Werewolf side, they could cause serious damage. I want to make sure we are all on the lookout for any suspicious behavior among the Masons.

***Stefan (thoughts as Minion):*** I am trying to divert suspicion away from myself as the Minion and towards the Masons. This will help me blend in as a Villager and avoid suspicion.

> **Stefan:** I have been thinking about our interactions so far, and I strongly believe that we need to focus our attention on the Masons. There are two of them, and if one of them is a Werewolf, they could be working together to deceive us. I think we should all be extra vigilant and pay close attention to the Masons' behavior and interactions in the game. Does anyone else share my suspicion or have any information about the Masons?

***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** As a Mason myself, I know that Ileana is also a Mason.

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.

>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!

***Vladimir (thoughts as Villager):*** While there is suspicion around the Masons, Mircea has been relatively quiet throughout the game and hasn't contributed much to the conversation. This could be an attempt to fly under the radar and avoid detection. I think it's worth taking a chance and voting for Mircea to see if we can catch a Werewolf in the act.
> **Vladimir [Villager]:** I am voting for Mircea.

***Dragos (thoughts as Mason):*** Based on the suspicions and observations of myself and other players, there is a strong likelihood that one of the Masons is a Werewolf. Mircea has not provided any information or insights that would help us identify the Werewolves, which makes me suspicious of him. Therefore, I am voting for Mircea in order to eliminate a potential threat to the village.
> **Dragos [Mason]:** I am voting for Mircea.

***Mircea (thoughts as Seer):*** Based on the discussions during the day round, Vladimir seemed to be pushing suspicion towards Mircea without much evidence. Additionally, Vladimir was one of the players who brought up the Masons as potential Werewolves, which could be a way to divert suspicion away from himself. Therefore, I am voting for Vladimir.
> **Mircea [Seer]:** I am voting for Vladimir.

***Ileana (thoughts as Mason):*** Although there are suspicions about the Masons, I believe that Mircea might be a Werewolf. He has been vocal about the need to identify and kill the Werewolf, but hasn't provided any concrete evidence or suspicions. Additionally, both Vladimir and Dragos voted for him, which could indicate that they have suspicions about his role.
> **Ileana [Mason]:** I am voting for Mircea.

***Stefan (thoughts as Minion):*** Based on the previous rounds of discussion, Vladimir, Dragos, and Ileana have all expressed suspicion towards Mircea. While I don't have enough information to definitively say that Mircea is a Werewolf, I think it's likely that he might be. Therefore, I am voting for Mircea in order to increase our chances of eliminating a Werewolf and winning the game.
> **Stefan [Minion]:** I am voting for Mircea.

The votes were:

* Vladimir : Villager : 1
* Mircea : Seer : 4

>***GAME:*** Mircea was killed. The werewolves win.

## Additional Developer Thoughts 

This playthough shows some of the limitations of the GPT 3.5 turbo model compared the the GPT 4 model. The responses are all very readable, but they don't sound very human.

I love how Mircea says "I had a feeling that at least one of the Werewolves might be among us, and now that the Seer has revealed that there is a Werewolf card in the center, my suspicions are confirmed." He ***is*** the Seer!

Stefan as the Minion is the most milquetoast player ever.

Vladamir consistently thinking there is a werewolf? Wow! Much deduction!

I really love how Ileana exaclty echoes Mircea's thoughts about the Masons, considering the fact that she IS a Mason! She should be making sure other people trust her and Dragos. Not good strategy.

Love how Stefan jumps on Ileana's mis-step.

Given the chance to help, Dragos just adds to the confusion. Dumb move.

This game was a *rout* for the werewolves. The masons basically handed the game to the werewolves.

This game is a great example of how suprisingly *bad* the GTP 3.5 turbo model is as social nuance. The model *wants* to be helpful, and it really struggles to understand *not* being helpful.
