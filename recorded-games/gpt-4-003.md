## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.

>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.

>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.

There are two werewolves in play, **Alexia** and **Andrei**. They are both now aware of each other.

>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.

>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.

There are no minions in play.

>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.

>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.

There is one mason in play, **Cristina**. They are aware they are the only mason in play.

>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.

>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.

There is one seer in play, **Viktor**. They are thinking about their action.

***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gather more information about the roles that are not in play. This will help me in deducing the roles of the other players and make more informed decisions during the day phase.

The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards ***Minion*** and ***Mason***

>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.

>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!

***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By claiming to be a villager, I am trying to gain the trust of the other players and start gathering information to understand their roles. This will help me identify potential threats to the werewolf team and plan a defense or misdirection accordingly.
> **Alexia:** Hey everyone, I'm a villager and I'm trying to figure out who the werewolves are. Does anyone have any information from the night phase that could help us?

***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** As a Seer, sharing the information I gathered from the night phase with others can help the village team deduce the roles of other players and find the werewolves. The more information we have, the better chance we have to make the right decision during the vote phase.
> **Viktor:** During the night phase, I looked at two center cards and found out that one of them is a Minion and the other is a Mason. This information should help us figure out the roles of the other players. So, anyone else would like to share their role or any information they have?

***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** I'm trying to gather more information from the other players to identify the Werewolves. By directing a question to Andrei, I hope to get him to reveal his role or provide some useful information.
> **Michael:** Since Viktor revealed his role as the Seer, I think it's safe to say I'm a Villager. Alexia also claimed to be a Villager, which leaves the possibility of Andrei and Cristina being Werewolves. Andrei, can you share any information on your role to help us narrow down our suspicions?

***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By claiming to be a Mason and connecting myself with Cristina as the other Mason, I can create trust between us and divert suspicion away from me being a Werewolf. This helps to protect both Alexia and myself as Werewolves.
> **Andrei:** Actually, I'm a Mason and during the night phase, I saw that Cristina is the other Mason. So, we can trust each other as we're both on the village team.

***Cristina (thoughts as Mason):*** I need to clarify the situation and raise suspicion about Andrei's claim, as I am the only Mason in the game. By confronting him, I can try to bring the focus on the possibility of Andrei being a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Cristina:** Andrei, I appreciate you trying to build trust, but actually I'm the only Mason. I didn't see any other Mason during the night phase, which means the other Mason card is in the center. So, I'm not sure about your claim of being a Mason.

***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By questioning Viktor's claim, I am trying to create doubt around his role as the Seer and potentially save Alexia and myself from being targeted as Werewolves. This also helps to redirect suspicion from my false claim of being a Mason.
> **Andrei:** Viktor, are you sure you saw a Minion and a Mason in the center? If Cristina is the only Mason, then your information might be inaccurate. Maybe you were mistaken, or maybe you're trying to mislead us.

***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** I want to clarify the situation with Andrei's claim because it contradicts my findings as a Seer and Cristina's claim of being the only Mason. By questioning Andrei, I hope to reveal the truth and help the village team make a better decision.
> **Viktor:** Andrei, I'm certain that I saw a Minion and a Mason in the center during the night phase. Cristina's claim of being the only Mason correlates with what I saw. Can you please explain why you claimed to see Cristina as the other Mason?

***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing a question to Cristina, I am trying to create a sense of trust and camaraderie, as well as deflect attention from my own false claim of being a Mason. Additionally, if Cristina shares any suspicions, it could help guide the group's focus away from the Werewolves.
> **Andrei:** Cristina, since you're the only Mason, can you share any insights or suspicions you might have about the others?

***Cristina (thoughts as Mason):*** I want to shift the suspicion towards Andrei, as his claim of being a Mason is false, and it's important to understand his true intentions. This might help the villagers to make a better decision during the VOTE phase.
> **Cristina:** Andrei, since you falsely claimed to be a Mason, it makes me doubt your intentions. Are you a Werewolf or the Minion trying to protect the Werewolves?

***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By admitting my confusion and focusing on the task of finding the Werewolves, I am trying to regain the trust of the other players and show that I am on the village team, even though I am a Werewolf. This helps to divert attention away from my false claim of being a Mason and redirects the focus to finding the Werewolves.
> **Andrei:** I understand my claim about being a Mason might look suspicious now that Cristina mentioned she's the only Mason, but I assure you I'm not a Werewolf or a Minion. I might have been confused during the night phase. Let's focus on finding the Werewolves together.

***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing a question to Michael and asking for his opinion on the suspicious players, I am trying to gain his trust and show that I am on the village team, despite my earlier false claim of being a Mason. This also helps to steer the conversation away from my earlier statement and gather more information from other players.
> **Andrei:** Michael, since you claim to be a Villager, who do you think are the most suspicious players right now? We need to work together and gather more information.

***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** I want to keep the focus on Andrei, who falsely claimed to be a Mason earlier. By directing a question at him, I hope to gain more information or gauge his reaction, which could help us determine if he's a Werewolf, a Minion, or just a confused Villager.
> **Michael:** Andrei, I'm still not convinced about your role since you falsely claimed to be a Mason. It's highly suspicious, and we need to be cautious about who we trust. Alexia, since you claimed to be a Villager like myself, and Viktor seems to be the Seer, we should focus on figuring out if Andrei is a Werewolf or a Minion. Andrei, if you're truly not a Werewolf or a Minion, can you provide any more information or suspicions you might have?

***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By summarizing the current situation and reaffirming my commitment to the village team, I am attempting to regain trust and steer the conversation away from my false Mason claim. I am also encouraging the other players to share any new information or suspicions they might have, which could potentially create confusion and protect both Alexia and myself as Werewolves.
> **Andrei:** Alright, let's consider the facts we have so far. Viktor claims to be the Seer and saw a Minion and a Mason in the center. Michael and Alexia are claiming to be Villagers. Cristina is the only Mason, which leaves me as the suspicious one due to my false Mason claim. However, I assure you all that I am on the village team and I am not a Werewolf or a Minion. So, let's focus on finding the Werewolves together. Does anyone have any new insights or suspicions?

***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing a question to Viktor, the Seer, I'm trying to gather more information to identify the Werewolves. I'm also reinforcing my claim as a Villager and maintaining suspicion on Andrei, who falsely claimed to be a Mason.
> **Alexia:** Viktor, since you're the Seer and you saw a Minion in the center, it means that there are only two Werewolves among us. I think we should focus on finding the Werewolves based on the information we have so far. Michael and I are claiming to be Villagers, Cristina is the only Mason, and you are the Seer. So, it seems that Andrei is either a Werewolf or the Minion. Can you share any more observations or suspicions?

***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** Since Andrei's false Mason claim is casting doubt on his intentions, it's crucial to get a clear explanation from him. By asking him to provide a logical reason for his claim, I hope to determine if he's genuinely on the village team or if he's a Werewolf or Minion trying to deceive us. Building trust among the village team members is essential for our success in finding the Werewolves.
> **Viktor:** Andrei, it's important for us to trust each other in order to find the Werewolves. Can you please provide any logical explanation for your false Mason claim? If you're truly on the village team, we need to be able to trust you.

***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By admitting my mistake and shifting the focus to finding inconsistencies or suspicious behavior, I am attempting to regain trust and steer the conversation away from my false Mason claim. This helps to create confusion and protect both Alexia and myself as Werewolves.
> **Andrei:** Alright, I admit that my false Mason claim was a mistake, but I can assure you all that I am on the village team, and I'm not a Werewolf or a Minion. As a team, we need to focus on finding the real Werewolves among us. Let's think about the interactions so far and see if we can find any inconsistencies or suspicious behavior.

***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** I want to encourage the players to evaluate the information we have so far and share their thoughts to help us find the Werewolves. By doing this, I hope to reveal any new insights or inconsistencies that can assist us in making a better decision during the vote phase.
> **Viktor:** Okay everyone, let's take a moment to analyze the situation. From the information we have, there should be two Werewolves among us. Alexia and Michael claim to be Villagers, Cristina is the only Mason, and I am the Seer. Andrei's false Mason claim is the only inconsistency so far, which makes him suspicious. However, he assures us that he's on the village team. We need to focus on finding the Werewolves, so please share any new observations or suspicions you might have.

***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** I want to keep the focus on analyzing the interactions between all players, including Alexia and myself, to see if we can find any inconsistencies or suspicious behavior that might indicate the presence of Werewolves or Minions. By reevaluating our interactions, we can hopefully gain more insights and identify the Werewolves.
> **Michael:** So, considering all the information we have, we can safely say that Cristina is the only Mason, and Viktor is the Seer. That leaves Alexia, Andrei, and myself as potential Werewolves or Minions. Although Andrei's false Mason claim is suspicious, he insists he's on the village team. Let's try to find inconsistencies in Alexia's and my statements to see if we can identify any Werewolf behavior. Did anyone notice anything strange or peculiar about our interactions?

***Cristina (thoughts as Mason):*** By directing a question to Alexia, I am trying to involve her more in the discussion and gather more information. This will help us in understanding everyone's stance and potentially uncover inconsistencies or suspicious behavior.
> **Cristina:** Alexia, you've been quite quiet since claiming to be a Villager. Can you provide any insights or suspicions that could help us identify the Werewolves?

***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By involving Cristina, the confirmed Mason, in the process of identifying Werewolves, I'm reinforcing my Villager claim and trying to gain her trust. This will also help me gather more information and insights to plan our next moves and keep the focus on either Michael or Andrei as potential Werewolves.
> **Alexia:** Cristina, since you're the only Mason and you can trust that Viktor is the Seer, I need your help in identifying the Werewolves. I've been trying to gather information from everyone's statements and actions so far. Michael and I both claim to be Villagers, and Andrei's false Mason claim is suspicious. Have you noticed any indicators or behaviors that make you suspect either Michael or Andrei could be a Werewolf?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.

>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!

***Alexia (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Andrei's false Mason claim is highly suspicious, and he hasn't been able to provide a logical explanation for it. Given the available information, it seems he could be a Werewolf or a Minion trying to protect the Werewolves.
> **Alexia [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Andrei.

***Viktor (thoughts as Seer):*** Andrei has been the most suspicious person with his false Mason claim, and we have no other solid evidence against any other players. We need to eliminate the Werewolves, and voting for Andrei seems like the most logical choice based on the information we have.
> **Viktor [Seer]:** I am voting for Andrei.

***Michael (thoughts as Villager):*** Andrei's false Mason claim and inability to provide a logical explanation make him the most suspicious among us. Although he insists he's on the village team, we need to be cautious and consider the possibility of him being a Werewolf or Minion.
> **Michael [Villager]:** I am voting for Andrei.

***Cristina (thoughts as Mason):*** Andrei's false claim of being a Mason has raised suspicion throughout the discussion, and despite his insistence that he's on the village team, we have not been able to identify a clear role for him. Considering the information from all other players, I believe voting for Andrei is the best option to identify a potential Werewolf or Minion and help the village team win.
> **Cristina [Mason]:** I am voting for Andrei.

***Andrei (thoughts as Werewolf):*** Although Andrei's false Mason claim is suspicious, he insists on being part of the village team. With Viktor as the Seer and Cristina as the only Mason, I will vote for Michael as a potential Werewolf to protect both Alexia and myself. Since both Michael and Alexia claimed to be Villagers, choosing Michael as the most suspicious player might create enough confusion to let the Werewolves win.
> **Andrei [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Michael.

The votes were:

* Michael : Villager : 1
* Andrei : Werewolf : 4

>***GAME:*** Andrei was killed. The villagers win.
