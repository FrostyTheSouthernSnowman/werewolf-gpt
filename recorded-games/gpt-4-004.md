## The ***NIGHT*** phase will now commence.

>***GAME:*** Everyone, close your eyes.

>***GAME:*** Werewolves, wake up and look for other Werewolves.

There are two werewolves in play, **Mircea** and **Dracula**. They are both now aware of each other.

>***GAME:*** Werewolves, close your eyes.

>***GAME:*** Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are.

**Andrei** is a minion and is aware that both **Mircea** and **Dracula** are werewolves.

>***GAME:*** Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Minion, close your eyes.

>***GAME:*** Masons, wake up and look for other Masons.

There is one mason in play, **Alexandra**. They are aware they are the only mason in play.

>***GAME:*** Masons, close your eyes.

>***GAME:*** Seer, wake up. You may look at another playerâ€™s card or two of the center cards.

There is one seer in play, **Larisa**. They are thinking about their action.

***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** By looking at two center cards, I can gather more information about the roles in play and potentially identify which roles are not active. This will help me deduce the roles of other players during the day phase, and contribute to making more informed decisions during the voting phase.

The seer looked at two cards from the center of the table and saw the cards ***Villager*** and ***Villager***

>***GAME:*** Seer, close your eyes.

## The ***DAY*** phase will now commence.

>***GAME:*** Everyone, Wake up!

***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By claiming to be the Seer, I can cast doubt on the actual Seer's claims and potentially manipulate the information shared by the players. This will help cover up my true role as a Werewolf and direct suspicion elsewhere.
> **Mircea:** Hey everyone, I was the Seer last night, and I checked two of the center cards. One of them was a Minion and the other a Villager.

***Andrei (thoughts as Minion):*** As the Minion, I want to support the Werewolves without drawing too much attention to myself. By acknowledging Mircea's statement and encouraging discussion, I am trying to blend in as a villager.
> **Andrei:** Interesting, Mircea! If you were the Seer and saw the Minion and Villager, that means we still have two Werewolves among us. Everyone, let's try to gather more information to find out who they are!

***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** Since I am actually the Seer and saw two Villager cards in the center, I need to point out the discrepancy in Mircea's claim to prevent misinformation from spreading and to raise suspicion on Mircea potentially being a Werewolf or the Minion trying to protect them.
> **Larisa:** Hold on, Mircea, I was the Seer last night and I also looked at two center cards, which were both Villagers. I think you might be trying to deceive us here.

***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** By revealing my role and sharing my information, I can help the village team gain more information. Since Mircea and Larisa have conflicting statements about being the Seer, I am directing a question at Mircea to gain more insight and verify their claims.
> **Alexandra:** I'm a Mason, and I didn't see another Mason last night, which means the other Mason card is in the center. There's something fishy going on here with Mircea and Larisa both claiming to be the Seer. Mircea, can you explain why you both have different claims about the center cards?

***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing a question to Larisa and asking her to provide more information, I am trying to cast doubt on her claim as the Seer and make it appear as if she's the one being deceptive, thus drawing suspicion away from myself.
> **Mircea:** Larisa, I don't understand why you're trying to contradict me. Could you tell us more about the center cards and why we should believe you?

***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** I need to challenge Mircea's false claim to establish my credibility as the true Seer, and also to pressure him into revealing his true motives for making a false claim. This will help us gather more information about potential Werewolves or Minions among the players.
> **Larisa:** Mircea, the reason why I am contradicting you is because I am the true Seer, and I saw two Villager cards in the center. I'm concerned about your false claim, as it could mean you're trying to protect the Werewolves by causing confusion. Can you explain why you claimed to see a Minion when I know for a fact that there were two Villagers?

***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By directing suspicion towards Dracula, my fellow Werewolf, I can create the illusion that I am suspicious of him and not associated with him. This would draw attention away from me as the other Werewolf and create confusion among the players.
> **Mircea:** Dracula, can you please share what you did last night and if you have any information that could help us determine who the Werewolves are?

***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I am claiming to be a Villager to appear innocent and to avoid suspicion. I want to direct the focus to others in the group, so I am asking Andrei about his role and thoughts on the conflicting Seer claims. This will help to create doubt among the players and take the attention away from me and my Werewolf partner, Mircea.
> **Dracula:** I was a Villager last night, so I didn't have any special abilities, but I do find it strange that both Mircea and Larisa claim to be the Seer. It seems like one of them might be a Werewolf trying to cover their tracks. Andrei, what was your role last night and do you have any thoughts on this situation?

***Andrei (thoughts as Minion):*** By directing a question to Dracula, I am taking some heat off of Mircea and myself, while still trying to appear as a concerned villager. This way, it keeps the focus on figuring out who the Werewolf might be between Mircea and Larisa.
> **Andrei:** It's definitely suspicious that both Mircea and Larisa are claiming to be the Seer. Dracula, since you're a Villager and have no special abilities, I'd like to hear your thoughts on who you think might be a Werewolf between Mircea and Larisa.

***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By putting more suspicion on Mircea, my Werewolf partner, I can distance myself from him and make myself appear more innocent. I want to see if Larisa has any more information to share, which could help create more confusion and doubt among the group.
> **Dracula:** I think it's more likely that Mircea is the Werewolf rather than Larisa, since Mircea mentioned seeing a Minion, which could be a convenient way for a Werewolf to try and disorient us. Larisa, can you please share your thoughts on this?

***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** By putting pressure on Mircea to address Dracula's suspicion and explain his false Seer claim, I hope to gather more information on his possible motives and determine if he is indeed a Werewolf or a Minion trying to protect the Werewolves.
> **Larisa:** Dracula, I appreciate your input and I also think that Mircea's claim about the Minion card seems like a strategy to confuse us. I still believe I am the true Seer and finding out the truth is crucial to winning this game for the village. Mircea, I would like to hear your thoughts on Dracula's suspicion of you being a Werewolf.

***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By addressing Dracula's suspicion and asking for concrete reasons, I am trying to defend my Seer claim while also appearing cooperative and village-minded, thus drawing suspicion away from myself.
> **Mircea:** Andrei, as a fellow player, I'd like to remind everyone that we should focus on finding the Werewolves and not on accusing each other. Larisa, I apologize for causing confusion, but I still stand by my Seer claim. Dracula, if you believe I am a Werewolf, can you give us any concrete reasons or observations as to why?

***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By continuing to put pressure on Mircea, my Werewolf partner, I can distance myself from him and make myself appear more innocent. Additionally, this maintains the focus on the Seer controversy, creating confusion and doubt among the players.
> **Dracula:** Mircea, I still find it very suspicious that you and Larisa have contradicting claims about being the Seer. Can you provide any stronger evidence to support your claim?

***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By encouraging players to share more information, I am trying to regain their trust and appear as a village-minded player, even though I'm a Werewolf. This could also help uncover more inconsistencies and direct suspicion away from myself and my fellow Werewolf.
> **Mircea:** Guys, I think we should all reconsider our suspicions and focus on finding the Werewolves. Can anyone else share any new information or insights to help the village?

***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By involving Alexandra, the Mason, in the conversation, I can further divert attention from myself and my Werewolf partner, Mircea. This also allows me to gather more information and gauge the suspicions of the other players.
> **Dracula:** Alexandra, as a Mason, how sure are you about the other Mason card being in the center? Do you have any thoughts on who could be the Werewolves among us?

***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** I want to gather more opinions and insights from other players, especially Andrei, who has been actively participating and trying to find the Werewolves. By directing a question to him, I hope to gain more information and potentially identify the Werewolves.
> **Alexandra:** Dracula, I am confident that the other Mason card is in the center since I didn't see another Mason during the night phase. I have a strong suspicion that Mircea could be a Werewolf due to the conflicting claims about the Seer role. Larisa seems to be more truthful and consistent in her statements. Andrei, I would like to hear your opinion on this matter since you've been quite observant throughout the game.

***Andrei (thoughts as Minion):*** By directing a question to Larisa and focusing on her Seer claim, I am drawing attention away from the Werewolves and myself as the Minion. This encourages other players to trust Larisa and her suspicions, potentially leading them away from the true Werewolves.
> **Andrei:** I agree with Alexandra that Mircea's Seer claim seems suspicious, especially with the conflicting information about the Minion card. As villagers, we need to work together to determine who's telling the truth and who might be a Werewolf. Larisa, if you are the true Seer, could you tell us if you have any suspicions about the other players based on their statements?

***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** By focusing on the conflict between Mircea and me, we can help the village team to find out the truth and work together to identify the Werewolves. The Seer role is important in this game, and resolving this conflict will give us more information to work with.
> **Larisa:** I believe that we should focus on determining the truth between Mircea and me, since the Seer role is crucial in finding the Werewolves. If we can establish who the real Seer is, we will be one step closer to identifying the Werewolves. Does anyone have any ideas on how we can resolve this conflict?

***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** By suggesting an unbiased evaluation from the other players, I am trying to appear cooperative and village-minded. This strategy allows me to continue defending my Seer claim while also involving the other players in the decision-making process, which could result in drawing suspicion away from myself and potentially identifying inconsistencies in Larisa's statements.
> **Mircea:** Guys, I have an idea to resolve this conflict between me and Larisa. Let's ask Andrei and Alexandra, who've been observant, to share their thoughts on who they believe is the true Seer based on our statements and interactions. This way, we can get an unbiased opinion and make a decision.

***Andrei (thoughts as Minion):*** Asking both Larisa and Mircea to share their suspicions about the Werewolves can help us determine who is the true Seer and who might be a Werewolf. I am trying to appear as a concerned villager by encouraging discussion and gathering information.
> **Andrei:** Larisa and Mircea, since you both claim to be the Seer, can each of you tell us who you think the Werewolves are based on the information and interactions so far?

## The ***VOTE*** phase will now commence.

>***GAME:*** It's time to vote!

***Mircea (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I am voting for Larisa because of the conflicting claims about being the Seer. I still stand by my Seer claim and believe that Larisa might be a Werewolf trying to cause confusion among the villagers. By voting for her, we may be able to eliminate a potential Werewolf and protect the village.
> **Mircea [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Larisa.

***Andrei (thoughts as Minion):*** I am voting for Larisa because, as the Minion, I want to protect the Werewolves and ensure their victory. By voting for Larisa, who is the true Seer, I am causing confusion and diverting attention away from the Werewolves. This will make it harder for the villagers to correctly identify the Werewolves and increases the chances of the Werewolf team winning.
> **Andrei [Minion]:** I am voting for Larisa.

***Larisa (thoughts as Seer):*** I am voting for Mircea because of the conflicting claims about being the Seer and the discrepancy in the center cards. Since I am the true Seer and saw two Villagers in the center, I believe Mircea may be a Werewolf or Minion trying to protect the Werewolves, causing confusion and deceiving the village team.
> **Larisa [Seer]:** I am voting for Mircea.

***Alexandra (thoughts as Mason):*** I am voting for Mircea because of the conflicting claims about the Seer role. Larisa's statements have been more consistent and truthful, while Mircea's claim about the Minion card seems more like a strategy to create confusion. As villagers, we need to identify and eliminate the Werewolves, and I believe Mircea is the most suspicious player in this game.
> **Alexandra [Mason]:** I am voting for Mircea.

***Dracula (thoughts as Werewolf):*** I still find it suspicious that both Mircea and Larisa claim to be the Seer, and I think it's more likely that Larisa is a Werewolf trying to deceive us. By voting for Larisa, I can help protect my Werewolf partner, Mircea, and increase our chances of winning the game.
> **Dracula [Werewolf]:** I am voting for Larisa.

The votes were:

* Mircea : Werewolf : 2
* Larisa : Seer : 3

>***GAME:*** Larisa was killed. The werewolves win.

## Additional Developer Thoughts 

Dude, this one was cool. The werewolves did a great job of sewing confusion, and it paid off in the end.

One cool thing that stands out here is how Mircea expressed his thoughts in the vote round. He seems to be wanting to vote off Werewolves, even though his is one. And Dracule got even more confused, saying "T think it's more likely that Larisa is a Werewolf trying to deceive us". Dude, you KNOW who the other Werewolf is.

These issues can definately be solved with prompt engineering. 

I just think the Werewolves lucked out. They won becuase the Minion (Andrei) and both Werewolves voted for Mircea, despite ALL of the them being confused.

More work to be done, but this game impressed me.
